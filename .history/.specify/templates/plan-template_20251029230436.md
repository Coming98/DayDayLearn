# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 16.0.1  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19.2.0, Tailwind CSS 4.x  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., local storage, session storage, external API or N/A]  
**Testing**: NONE (per constitution - no testing infrastructure allowed)  
**Target Platform**: Web (mobile-first responsive design)
**Project Type**: Next.js web application  
**Performance Goals**: [e.g., <2s page load on 3G, Core Web Vitals "Good" or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [e.g., mobile-first, accessibility standards, bundle size limits or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [e.g., number of pages, expected users, content volume or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Clean Code**: Feature design maintains single responsibility principle and clear naming
- [ ] **Simple UX**: User flows prioritize simplicity and minimal cognitive load
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: All interfaces work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: External dependencies are justified by significant value delivery
- [ ] **No Testing**: Feature MUST NOT include any testing infrastructure or test files
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Uses Next.js 16.0.1, React 19.2.0, and Tailwind CSS 4.x only

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
