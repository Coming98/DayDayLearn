# Tasks: QANC Learning System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-qanc-learning-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: This template MUST NOT include any testing tasks. Testing infrastructure is explicitly forbidden per the DayDayLearn Constitution.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Next.js app structure**: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` at repository root
- Feature-specific pages go in `app/[feature]/`
- Shared components go in `app/components/` or `components/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create Next.js app directory structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize TypeScript configuration and dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure ESLint and code formatting tools
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup Tailwind CSS configuration and base styles in app/globals.css
- [ ] T005 [P] Install and configure Zustand state management dependency
- [ ] T006 [P] Create TypeScript type definitions in types/card.ts
- [ ] T007 [P] Create TypeScript type definitions in types/review.ts
- [ ] T008 [P] Create TypeScript type definitions in types/storage.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks for Next.js applications:

- [ ] T009 Setup root layout with responsive design framework in app/layout.tsx
- [ ] T010 [P] Create localStorage repository base class in lib/storage/repository.ts
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement schema migrations system in lib/storage/migrations.ts
- [ ] T012 [P] Create Ebbinghaus curve spaced repetition algorithm in lib/scheduler/spaced-repetition.ts
- [ ] T013 [P] Implement card validation rules in lib/validation/card-rules.ts
- [ ] T014 [P] Create base UI components Button in app/components/ui/Button.tsx
- [ ] T015 [P] Create base UI components Input in app/components/ui/Input.tsx
- [ ] T016 [P] Create base UI components Select in app/components/ui/Select.tsx
- [ ] T017 [P] Create ProgressIndicator component in app/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.tsx
- [ ] T018 Setup error handling and user feedback system in lib/utils/error-handling.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create and Edit Cards (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to create atomic knowledge cards with Q/A/Notes structure and manage them

**Independent Validation**: Create a new card with Q/A content, add notes, verify card is saved and displayable

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T032 [P] [US2] Create ReviewEvent entity and review session store in lib/store/session.ts
- [ ] T033 [P] [US2] Create review service layer with session management in lib/services/review-service.ts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Components before pages that use them
- Shared utilities before feature-specific code  
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create CardView display component in app/components/card/CardView.tsx"
Task: "Create FaceQ component for question display in app/components/card/FaceQ.tsx"
Task: "Create FaceA component for answer display in app/components/card/FaceA.tsx"
Task: "Create FaceNote component for note display in app/components/card/FaceNote.tsx"
Task: "Create MediaElement component for media attachments in app/components/card/MediaElement.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Manually test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Manually validate independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Manually validate independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Manually validate independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently (manual validation)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability  
- Each user story should be independently completable and manually validatable
- Manual validation replaces automated testing per constitution
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to manually validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
